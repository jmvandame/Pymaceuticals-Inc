In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

At the onset of analysis, it was important to note mouse ‘g989’ was removed from data, as validity of duplicate information could not be confirmed. 

Tumor volume was lowest on drug regimen Ramicane, and the the greatest variance among the mice on the Ketapril regimen. 

The study contained just slightly more male than female mice, further analysis would be required to compare tumor size among the gender of the mice.

The data additionally identified a positive correlation between weight and tumor volume, i.e., larger mice had larger tumors.  

One outliner was identified on the drug regimen Infubinol, and needs further review to see if the data should be removed. 

For Pymaceuticals, the Capomulin treatment showed an overall decrease in Tumor size for the first 30+ days of the study, around day 35 tumor volume began to increase, further analysis would be needed of greater duration.
